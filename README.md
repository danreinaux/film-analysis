# film-analysis

This is my project for the 'Introduction to Data Analysis' course from Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

In this project, I conduct and end-to-end analysis of a movies dataset. Although the data collection step has already been done (provided in a csv file), using Python I executed necessary data wrangling, exploratory analysis and communication of my conclusions.
